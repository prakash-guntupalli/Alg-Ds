// Binary Heap is similar to binary search tree, each parent can have 2 children and left children are filled first
// Binary heaps are used to implement priority Queues and in graph traversal algorithms.

// MaxBinary Heap - Parent nodes are always larger than child nodes (no order between siblings)
// MinBinary Heap - Parent nodes are smaller than child nodes

// For any index of an array 'n', left child will be at '2n+1' & right child at '2n+2'
